# Rewordly Assets

This directory contains the icon assets required for the Outlook Add-in.

## Required Icons

The manifest.xml references these icon sizes:
- `icon-16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon-32.png` (32x32 pixels) 
- `icon-80.png` (80x80 pixels)
- `hi-res-icon.png` (High resolution for retina displays)

## Icon Specifications

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Clean, professional, representing AI/email assistance
- **Colors**: Should work well with Office UI themes
- **Design**: Simple, recognizable at small sizes

## Current Status

The icon files are currently placeholder references. You need to:

1. Create or obtain appropriate icon files
2. Place them in this directory
3. Update the manifest.xml URLs to point to your actual icon files

## Alternative: Use a CDN

You can also host icons on a CDN and update the manifest.xml URLs accordingly.
